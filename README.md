<p class="AssignmentsLevel1">The Stevens Company is converting from the SQL Server<sup>速</sup> database to the Oracle<sup>速</sup> database.

<p class="AssignmentsLevel1"><strong>Using</strong> the sample shown below, create a Risk Information Sheet for at least five potential risks that might be encountered during the conversion.  At least three of the five risks you choose should be project management related.

<p class="AssignmentsLevel1">

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" align="center">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="308"><p align="center">Risk Information Sheet</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="308"><strong>Risk Description</strong>:</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="308"><strong>Probability</strong>:</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="308"><strong>Impact</strong>:</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="308"><strong>Rationale</strong>:</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="308"><strong>Risk Mitigation</strong>:</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>

<p class="AssignmentsLevel1">Please <strong>note</strong> the following:

<ul>

 <li>The risk description should fully describe the risk</li>

 <li>The probability is the likelihood that the risk will occur (i.e., low, medium, or high)</li>

 <li>The impact is how the organization will be effected if the risk does occur (i.e., low, medium, or high)</li>

 <li>The rationale should explain the reasons for your probability and impact assessments</li>

 <li>The mitigation strategy should explain how each risk will be addressed</li>

 <li>There should be one risk information sheet for each risk identified</li>

 <li>The risk information sheets can be completed in Word, Excel<sup>速</sup>, or PowerPoint<sup>速</sup></li>

</ul>
